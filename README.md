# Automated Network Configuration and Compliance Management System using NETCONF/YANG 

## Project Overview
Developing a system that automates network device configurations and continuously assesses compliance against predefined standards. This project will leverage Netconf for communication with network devices and YANG models to define configuration data and operational state.

## Objectives
- Automate the deployment of network configurations across multiple devices.
- Ensure configurations adhere to organizational standards and regulatory compliance.
- Provide real-time monitoring and assessment of network device configurations.
- Generate reports and alerts for non-compliant configurations.

## Components

1. **Netconf Client**:
   - Develop or use an existing Netconf client to communicate with network devices.
   - The client will handle tasks such as retrieving and pushing configurations.

2. **YANG Models**:
   - Utilize standard YANG models (e.g., IETF, OpenConfig) or create custom YANG models to represent device configurations and operational states.
   - Models will serve as templates for configuration and compliance checks.

3. **Configuration Templates**:
   - Define configuration templates using YANG models.
   - Templates will include best practices and compliance requirements (e.g., security settings, interface configurations).

4. **Automation Engine**:
   - Implement an automation engine (using Python, Ansible, or other orchestration tools) that:
     - Applies configuration templates to network devices.
     - Collects configuration data from devices via Netconf.
     - Validates device configurations against YANG models.

5. **Compliance Checker**:
   - Develop a module that continuously monitors device configurations.
   - Compare current configurations against predefined standards (using YANG models).
   - Identify and flag deviations.

6. **Reporting and Alerts**:
   - Generate compliance reports summarizing the configuration status of all devices.
   - Set up alerts for non-compliant configurations or failed configuration updates.
   - Implement a dashboard for real-time visibility into network compliance status.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Initial Configuration**:
   - Set up a development environment with Netconf and YANG tools.
   - Choose network devices that support Netconf/YANG (e.g., Cisco, Juniper).
   - Install and configure a Netconf server on the devices.

2. **Develop YANG Models**:
   - Identify necessary configuration parameters.
   - Develop or customize YANG models to reflect your network's configuration standards.

3. **Build the Netconf Client**:
   - Implement a client to handle communication with network devices.
   - Ensure the client can retrieve current configurations and apply new configurations.

4. **Create Configuration Templates**:
   - Define standard configurations using YANG models.
   - Store these templates in a version-controlled repository.

5. **Implement the Automation Engine**:
   - Script the application of configuration templates using the Netconf client.
   - Ensure idempotent operations (reapplying the same configuration should have no side effects).

6. **Develop the Compliance Checker**:
   - Script checks that validate device configurations against the YANG models.
   - Log results and flag non-compliant configurations.

7. **Build Reporting and Alerting Mechanisms**:
   - Create scripts or use tools (like Grafana, ELK stack) for generating reports and dashboards.
   - Set up alerting (using email, Slack, etc.) for immediate notification of issues.

8. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test the system in a lab environment with various network scenarios.
   - Validate the accuracy of configuration deployments and compliance checks.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Python (with ncclient library), Ansible
- **Netconf Libraries**: `ncclient` for Python
- **Orchestration Tools**: Ansible, Nornir
- **Reporting Tools**: Grafana, Kibana (part of the ELK stack)
- **Version Control**: Git

## Potential Challenges

- Ensuring compatibility with different network devices and vendors.
- Handling complex configurations and dependencies between configuration parameters.
- Maintaining up-to-date YANG models as standards evolve.
- Scaling the solution for large and diverse network environments.

## Benefits

- Consistent and error-free network configurations.
- Improved compliance with industry standards and regulations.
- Reduced manual effort and faster deployment of network changes.
- Enhanced visibility and control over network configurations.
